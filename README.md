# Welcome to the LangGraph Workflow Playground!

This repository is your hands-on guide to mastering LangGraph for building smart, persistent, and flexible workflows in Python. Whether you're a beginner or an advanced user, you'll find everything you need to understand, experiment, and extend workflow automation using Jupyter notebooks.

---

## What is LangGraph?
LangGraph is a Python library that lets you build workflows as graphs, where each node can be a function, a prompt, or any logic you want. It supports state management, persistence, and parallel execution, making it perfect for real-world automation, data science, and AI projects.

## üìö Notebooks: Your Learning Journey

Each notebook in this repo is a step-by-step story. Here‚Äôs what you‚Äôll find:

- **0_test_installation.ipynb**
   - *Purpose*: Make sure your environment is set up and LangGraph is installed correctly.
   - *What to do*: Run all cells. If you see no errors, you‚Äôre good to go!

- **1_BMI_workflow.ipynb**
   - *Purpose*: Learn how to build a simple workflow for calculating BMI (Body Mass Index).
   - *Key Concepts*: State definition, node creation, graph compilation, and basic invocation.
   - *Try it*: Change the input values and see how the workflow responds.

- **2_simple_llm_workflow.ipynb**
   - *Purpose*: See how to use LangGraph with a language model (LLM) for Q&A or text generation.
   - *Key Concepts*: Integrating LLMs, prompt chaining, and state updates.
   - *Try it*: Ask different questions and watch the workflow generate answers.

- **3_propmt_chaining.ipynb**
   - *Purpose*: Explore how to chain multiple prompts and nodes to create a blog post generator.
   - *Key Concepts*: Sequential node execution, passing state between nodes, and evaluation.
   - *Try it*: Tweak the prompts or add new steps to customize your workflow.

- **batsman_workflow.ipynb**
   - *Purpose*: Dive into parallel workflows using cricket batsman statistics as an example.
   - *Key Concepts*: Parallel node execution, reducers, and merging state updates.
   - *Try it*: Add more batsmen or stats to see how parallelism works.

- **10_persistence.ipynb**
   - *Purpose*: Master advanced features like persistence, state history, time travel, and multi-threaded workflows.
   - *Key Concepts*: Checkpointing, restoring state, updating state at any point, and running multiple threads (sessions).
   - *Try it*: Experiment with updating state at a checkpoint, invoking from that point, and exploring the state history.

## üß† Key Concepts Explained (In Plain English)

### Persistence
Imagine you‚Äôre playing a video game and you can save your progress at any point. LangGraph lets you do the same with workflows! You can checkpoint the state, come back later, and pick up right where you left off. This is great for long-running tasks, experiments, or debugging.

### State History
Every time your workflow changes, LangGraph keeps a log. You can look back and see every step, every change, and every result. This is super useful for understanding what happened, finding bugs, or just being curious.

### Time Travel
Ever wish you could go back and change something? With LangGraph, you can! Update the state at any checkpoint, then re-run the workflow from that point. It‚Äôs like rewinding and rewriting history.

### Threads (Sessions)
You can run multiple workflows in parallel, each with its own state and history. Think of threads as separate workspaces‚Äîgreat for handling multiple users, tasks, or experiments at once.

1. **Clone the repository**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/SM0311/LangGraph.git
    cd LangGraph
    ```
2. **Set up your environment**
    - Create a virtual environment:

## üîç Practical Examples

### Persistence & Time Travel
```python
# Save your workflow state at a checkpoint
workflow.update_state({'configurable':{'thread_id':'1','checkpoint_id':"<checkpoint_id>"}},{'topic':'samosa'})

# Re-run the workflow from that checkpoint
result = workflow.invoke(None, {'configurable': {'thread_id': '1', 'checkpoint_id': '<checkpoint_id>'}})
print(result)
```

### State History
```python
# See every step your workflow took
history = list(workflow.get_state_history({'configurable':{'thread_id':'1'}}))
for state in history:
      print(state)
```

### Multi-Threaded Workflows
```python
# Run two workflows at the same time
config1 = {'configurable':{'thread_id':'1'}}
config2 = {'configurable':{'thread_id':'2'}}
workflow.invoke({'topic':'pizza'}, config=config1)
workflow.invoke({'topic':'pasta'}, config=config2)
```

## üí° Tips & Best Practices

- Always invoke from the checkpoint you updated to see your changes.
- Use thread IDs to keep your workflows organized and independent.
- Check state history to debug, audit, or just understand your workflow‚Äôs journey.
- Don‚Äôt be afraid to experiment‚ÄîLangGraph is designed for exploration!
