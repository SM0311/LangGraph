    "essay = \"\"\"The Role of Technology in Shaping the Future\n",
    "\n",
    "In the contemporary world, technology has become the cornerstone of human progress, influencing almost every aspect of our lives. From the way we communicate to the way we work, travel, and even think, the digital revolution has redefined the boundaries of possibility. The question is no longer whether technology shapes the future, but how wisely we harness its power.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the most profound contributions of technology lies in its ability to connect people across geographical and cultural divides. The internet and social media platforms have transformed the globe into a \"digital village,\" where ideas and information travel faster than ever before. This interconnectedness fosters collaboration, innovation, and cultural exchange, making the world more interdependent than at any other point in history.\n",
    "\n",
    "Equally important is the role of technology in healthcare. Breakthroughs in artificial intelligence, biotechnology, and robotics are not only prolonging human life but also enhancing its quality. Diseases once considered fatal are now manageable, and precision medicine promises tailored treatments that meet the unique needs of individuals. Technology, therefore, stands as a beacon of hope in the quest for healthier and more fulfilling lives.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, it would be naïve to view technology as a purely benevolent force. Its misuse has led to cybercrime, data breaches, and ethical dilemmas surrounding privacy. Moreover, automation and artificial intelligence, while enhancing efficiency, also threaten traditional employment structures, leaving millions anxious about their livelihoods. Thus, the challenge before humanity is not the advancement of technology itself, but the wisdom with which we choose to employ it.\n",
    "\n",
    "In conclusion, technology is both a gift and a responsibility. It holds the potential to create unprecedented opportunities, but it also demands thoughtful regulation and ethical application. As we move forward, it is imperative to strike a delicate balance—embracing innovation while safeguarding human values. The future will not be determined by technology alone, but by our collective ability to ensure that it serves humanity rather than dominates it.\"\"\""

    "Technology is very important in today’s world and it is everywhere. People are using it for many things like phone, internet, computer, and it is always increasing. Technology makes life easy but sometimes also it makes problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "One good thing of technology is that it helps people to talk. Like if someone is far away, you can call them or message them. Social media is also there and people use it every day. This is making life fast and simple.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another important thing is in health. Doctors use machines and computers. There are new medicines and robots in hospitals. This can save people and make them live long.\n",
    "\n",
    "But technology also has bad things. People spend too much time on mobile and internet. It also make people lazy. Many jobs are going because machines can do them now. So people are losing work and it is a big problem for the future.\n",
    "\n",
    "In conclusion, technology is good and bad. We should use it in right way. If we use too much it is bad but if we use it less it is not useful. So it is important to balance.\"\"\""

       "{'essay': 'The Role of Technology in Shaping the Future\\n\\nIn the contemporary world, technology has become the cornerstone of human progress, influencing almost every aspect of our lives. From the way we communicate to the way we work, travel, and even think, the digital revolution has redefined the boundaries of possibility. The question is no longer whether technology shapes the future, but how wisely we harness its power.\\n\\nOne of the most profound contributions of technology lies in its ability to connect people across geographical and cultural divides. The internet and social media platforms have transformed the globe into a \"digital village,\" where ideas and information travel faster than ever before. This interconnectedness fosters collaboration, innovation, and cultural exchange, making the world more interdependent than at any other point in history.\\n\\nEqually important is the role of technology in healthcare. Breakthroughs in artificial intelligence, biotechnology, and robotics are not only prolonging human life but also enhancing its quality. Diseases once considered fatal are now manageable, and precision medicine promises tailored treatments that meet the unique needs of individuals. Technology, therefore, stands as a beacon of hope in the quest for healthier and more fulfilling lives.\\n\\nHowever, it would be naïve to view technology as a purely benevolent force. Its misuse has led to cybercrime, data breaches, and ethical dilemmas surrounding privacy. Moreover, automation and artificial intelligence, while enhancing efficiency, also threaten traditional employment structures, leaving millions anxious about their livelihoods. Thus, the challenge before humanity is not the advancement of technology itself, but the wisdom with which we choose to employ it.\\n\\nIn conclusion, technology is both a gift and a responsibility. It holds the potential to create unprecedented opportunities, but it also demands thoughtful regulation and ethical application. As we move forward, it is imperative to strike a delicate balance—embracing innovation while safeguarding human values. The future will not be determined by technology alone, but by our collective ability to ensure that it serves humanity rather than dominates it.',\n",
       " 'language_feedback': 'The essay presents a well-structured argument about the role of technology, highlighting both its positive contributions and potential risks. The introduction effectively sets the tone and context for the discussion. The use of varied vocabulary and complex sentence structures demonstrates a strong command of language. However, the essay could benefit from more concrete examples to enhance the persuasiveness of its points, especially in addressing the negative aspects of technology. Additionally, some sentences feel slightly verbose; tighter phrasing could improve clarity without sacrificing depth. Overall, the essay communicates its message effectively but could be enhanced with more specific examples and slightly more concise language.',\n",
       " 'analysis_feedback': 'The essay presents a well-rounded perspective on the role of technology in shaping the future. It effectively highlights both the positive contributions and the potential downsides of technology. The structure is logical with clear transitions between points, offering a holistic view of the topic. However, the analysis could delve deeper into specific technologies or examples that illustrate the points made. For instance, discussing the impact of specific AI applications or particular social media platforms could enhance the argument. Additionally, exploring potential solutions to the challenges posed by technology could strengthen the conclusion. Overall, while the essay covers essential ideas concisely, more in-depth analysis and specific examples would elevate it further.',\n",

The use of phrases like \"digital village\" and metaphors like \"a beacon of hope\" add vividness to the argument, enhancing clarity. The conclusion effectively synthesizes the main points and emphasizes the need for balance in technological advancement.\\n\\nHowever, some areas could be improved for even greater clarity. For instance, expanding on specific examples of technological advancements discussed could strengthen the arguments. Additionally, some transitions between ideas could be smoother to enhance the flow of thought. Overall, the essay maintains a strong clarity of thought, capturing both the optimistic and cautionary aspects of technology\\'s influence on our future.',\n",

    "essay3=\"\"\"In the twenty-first century, technology has transcended its role as a mere tool and emerged as the architect of human progress. It is no exaggeration to claim that technology shapes not only the way we live but also the way we imagine the future. From communication and healthcare to education and governance, technological innovations have redefined possibilities. The challenge, however, is to ensure that this extraordinary force remains an instrument of empowerment rather than a source of division.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the most transformative impacts of technology lies in communication. The internet has effectively turned the world into what Marshall McLuhan once envisioned as a “global village.” Platforms such as X (formerly Twitter) and WhatsApp have allowed instantaneous connection, enabling information to flow across continents within seconds. For instance, during natural disasters, real-time updates on social media have saved countless lives by facilitating rapid responses. Yet, this very immediacy can also fuel misinformation, highlighting the double-edged nature of digital interconnectedness.\n",
    "\n",
    "Equally significant are the breakthroughs in healthcare. Artificial intelligence is revolutionizing medical diagnostics, with algorithms now capable of detecting diseases like cancer at earlier stages than human doctors. In addition, innovations in biotechnology and robotics are enabling precision surgeries and personalized treatments, offering hope to millions. The COVID-19 pandemic demonstrated how technology, through vaccine development and digital telemedicine platforms, can act as humanity’s lifeline during crises.\n",
    "\n",
    "Nevertheless, technology is not without its perils. Automation and artificial intelligence threaten to displace millions of workers, especially in manufacturing and transport. Similarly, data breaches and cyberattacks expose individuals and nations to unprecedented risks.

People are using it for many things like phone, internet, computer, and it is always increasing. Technology makes life easy but sometimes also it makes problems.\\n\\nOne good thing of technology is that it helps people to talk. Like if someone is far away, you can call them or message them. Social media is also there and people use it every day. This is making life fast and simple.\\n\\nAnother important thing is in health. Doctors use machines and computers. There are new medicines and robots in hospitals. This can save people and make them live long.\\n\\nBut technology also has bad things. People spend too much time on mobile and internet. It also make people lazy. Many jobs are going because machines can do them now. So people are losing work and it is a big problem for the future.\\n\\nIn conclusion, technology is good and bad. We should use it in right way. If we use too much it is bad but if we use it less it is not useful. So it is important to balance.',\n",

Furthermore, the essay addresses the dual nature of technology, discussing both its benefits and potential risks, which adds depth to the analysis. However, while the essay presents a well-rounded view, it could benefit from a deeper exploration of the ethical implications and perhaps a more nuanced discussion of potential solutions to the digital divide and job displacement rather than a brief mention. Additionally, the transitions between paragraphs could be smoother to enhance the overall coherence of the argument. Overall, this makes for an insightful essay that captures the essence of technology's role in shaping modern society but could be strengthened with deeper engagement with the complexities involved.\",\n",
       " 'clarity_feedback': 'The essay presents a coherent argument about the transformative role of technology in society, effectively covering communication, healthcare, education, employment, and ethical concerns. The examples provided are timely and relevant, illustrating both the benefits and the drawbacks of technological advancements. The structure is clear, with a logical flow from one point to the next, and the conclusion ties the discussion back to the central theme of responsible governance of technology.\\n\\nHowever, while the essay is overall clear in its arguments, there are areas that could benefit from additional depth or clarity. For example, while it mentions the digital divide, it would be strong to include discussion about potential solutions or ongoing efforts to address it. The transition between discussing the benefits of technology and the risks could be smoother to enhance flow. Additionally, some sentences are dense and could be simplified for greater clarity.\\n\\nOverall, the essay effectively communicates the complex relationship between society and technology, while also emphasizing the need for responsible governance.

       " 'language_feedback': 'The essay presents a clear argument about the dual nature of technology, discussing both its benefits and drawbacks. However, the language quality requires improvement in several areas:\\n\\n1. **Grammar and Syntax**: There are several instances of incorrect verb forms and missing articles, such as \"Technology help\" should be \"Technology helps\". Also, phrases like \"this make people sad\" need the correct subject-verb agreement, which should be \"this makes people sad\". Translating thoughts directly into English can lead to awkward sentence structures, affecting clarity.\\n\\n2. **Word Choice**: Some words are overly simple or informal, such as using \"good but also bad\"; it would be more articulate to state \"has both positive and negative aspects\". Additionally, variations in language could enhance the essay. For example, instead of repeatedly saying \"technology,\" alternative phrases or synonyms could be used.\\n\\n3. **Cohesion and Coherence**: The essay lacks smooth transitions between ideas. For instance, the transition from discussing communication to health feels abrupt. Including transitional phrases would improve the flow of the essay.\\n\\n4. **Complexity**: The essay would benefit from attempting more complex sentence structures to articulate thoughts more fluidly. Engaging with more complex ideas, such as ethical aspects of technology, could enrich the discussion.\\n\\n5. **Depth of Argument**: While the essay addresses important points, it remains somewhat superficial. Providing specific examples or elaborating on key ideas (like the impact of technology on jobs or education) could strengthen the argument.\\n\\nIn summary, the essay covers the topic adequately but must improve in grammatical accuracy, vocabulary diversity, coherence, and depth.

However, the depth of analysis is quite limited. The points made are general and lack supporting details, examples, or evidence that would strengthen the arguments. Furthermore, the writing contains grammatical and structural issues that detract from its clarity. The essay would benefit from more specific examples illustrating how technology aids or hinders different aspects of life, as well as a more nuanced discussion of both positive and negative consequences.

       " 'clarity_feedback': \"The essay presents a clear dichotomy regarding technology, highlighting both its advantages and disadvantages. However, the thought process lacks depth and precision. The initial statements about technology being 'good but also bad' are overly simplistic and could benefit from more nuanced reasoning. Each paragraph introduces concepts that are relevant but are not fully explored; for instance, while the advantages of communication and healthcare technologies are mentioned, specific examples or data could greatly enhance the discussion. Additionally, there are issues with grammar and sentence structure that detract from clarity. Phrases like 'technology help' should be corrected to 'technology helps' for grammatical accuracy. The conclusion reiterates the main points, but reinforces a vague perspective instead of offering a definitive stance or solution.
